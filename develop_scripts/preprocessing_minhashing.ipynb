What you once were means nothing to who you are now. You are standing next to Ivan Denisovich , stay next to him , and survive.That first little bit sounds pretentious , but it's kind of like the emotional tone I got from the book... What I liked about the novel is it's clear , simple and straight-away style. It brings the reader right into the action and doesn't waste time moralizing on the evils of Communism. It's the story itself that brings that messsage to you. A classic.\n"
