      "This is a short, easy to read book, intended to give some advice to young couples contemplating marriage. This slow reader began and finished the book within a couple hours, but the length of time reading the book does not reflect how useful the book is. Some of Dobson's main points are: keep Christ as the center of your relationship (Dobson being an evengelical Christian, writing to others who strongly value Christ); make sure you see eye-to-eye on the big things and be prepared to get into big fights about little things; men and women think differently and it would benefit you greatly to learn the way the other sex thinks. Dobson writes in a fluid style and liberally sprinkles in anecdotes, research, and selections from others' works to make his points. In doing this, he makes his main points stand out and makes his book a fun, lighthearted one written about a subject that is anything but light. Recommended.\n"
