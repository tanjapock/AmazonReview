B000C25VKU,3.0,"I found the reading of Reich's first novel, Deja Dead, to be a bit ponderous but all the scenes of Montreal really stuck with me. Still, the slow pacing made me reluctant to read her second book. Now I've read it - and it has almost the opposite problem. I had no problem with inhaling it in an evening. But when it was over I was left feeling unsatisfied.Fundamentally, the flaw in this book is the huge use of coincidence. Everywhere Tempe goes she runs into murder (the Jessica Fletcher syndrome). OK, I can deal with that. But that she happens to stumble onto murders in different countries that are related? That her sister just happens to fall in the circle of the murderers? Just too much for my pragmatic mind...I like Tempe and her supporting cast. I'm just hoping that this is only a case of second novel fails to follow the big debut and that the third novel will be a dandy.",en
B000N6DGKW,5.0,"I first read The Scarlet Letter in high school-required reading of course. Even though I enjoyed other works by Hawthorne (""Rappaccini's Daughter"" for instance), getting through ""The Scarlet Letter"" was true drudgery. At that time, the book's wordiness and description density got in the way of the plot. Also, I thought the Rev. Dimmesdale was a dwerb (I still do). It wasn't until my son transferred to a new school and complained about having to reread the book that I picked it up again. If he had to suffer through it twice, I figured I would too--and it was worth it.This time around I listened to the book on tape. It was a much better experience. Yes, the characteristics I had complained about earlier remain-the density of description relative to action, the seeming irrelevance of the long prologue to the body of the book, and the antique language and culturally alien setting. But hearing the words rather than seeing them on the page gave them an immediacy and an impact that I had missed earlier-there were even (gasp!) occasional hints of humor in the turn of a phrase. In fact, Hawthorne seemed strikingly modern in his understanding of the subtleties of character; notions of guilt, repression, and revenge; and even his thoughts on the role of women.As a writer, Hawthorne frequently made use of supernatural themes and references to convey psychological truths. ""The Scarlet Letter"" is no exception. Chillingsworth's researches are those of an alchemist; Mistress Hibbins believes herself a witch; and Pearl, Hester's preternaturally perceptive and occasionally perverse child, is compared to an elf. These Gothic elements are descriptions of the exterior world, but they help form our understanding of the interior world of the characters on which the plot of the book turns. Chillingworth's vengeance, because it-like the work of an alchemist-- is undertaken by choice, is seen as far more evil than Hester and Dimmesdale's adultery, a sin of nature and love. Hester's acceptance of her crime and its punishment becomes her strength. Dimmesdale's decline, in contrast, results from his own weakness and guilt in not acknowledging his role in the illicit affair. Hawthorne's description of his descent into a madness that destroys both mind and body is a stunning and even clinically relevant piece of writing.All in all, ""The Scarlet Letter ""is not an easy book and definitely not a book for everyone. But for those who are willing to undertake its complexities of language, allegory and symbolism, it is an extremely rewarding one.",en
B000K7BCOQ,5.0,"Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-5 is classified as science-fiction and generalized as an anti-war novel. Neither description does this story justice. Billy Pilgrim journeys through World War Two, life, and time. Vonnegut's chronicle encompasses far more than aliens and battles. In an original, genre-bending way, this best-selling author spins a tale that effectively comments on most aspects of life and society.Kurt Vonnegut is a veteran of World War Two. He was captured by the Germans and help as a prisoner of war in Dresden, Germany. Dresden is a city that was known for its fantastic architecture and genuine beauty. Vonnegut was present in the city when it was bombed by the Americans and reduced to craters and rubble. As a witness of the devastation, Vonnegut returned years later to tell the story of what he had seen and experienced. What he produced was Slaughterhouse-5. Vonnegut's story follows Billy Pilgrim, a man who says he has become unstuck in time. Billy will blink, snooze, enter a door, and end up in another decade. Billy has ""seen his birth and death many times, he says, and pays random visits to all the events in between"" (page 29). Slaughterhouse-5 follows Billy's random visits to those events.Most of Billy's random visits take him back behind enemy lines during World War Two, to a zoo on the alien planet Tralfamadore, and to his life after the war. He learns many important lessons, but they are not what one would expect. Billy says that ""the most important thing that I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. ... When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition at that particular moment, but that same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say... `So it goes'"" (33-34). Billy learns from the aliens that death is unimportant. He also finds out the date, time, and manner of his own death. He experiences it and is far from distraught. He is shot, and ""in the next moment, Billy Pilgrim is dead. So it goes"" (182). Another time-jump follows. People live and die all around him, but Billy does not care; he knows they are still alive in the past.A second main point in this book is, predictably, an anti-war message. A woman named Mary tries to prevent the author from writing this book because she fears he will glorify war and cause more wars to be fought. The author agrees that World War Two was fought by babies, ""right at the end of childhood"" (18) and says he will call it ""the Children's Crusade."" In actuality, the full name of Vonnegut's novel is Slaughterhouse-5 or the Children's Crusade: A Duty Dance with Death. This novel truly is a dance with death, for nearly every character dies, from Billy's fellow soldiers to his wife to a bum on the train. This abundance of death, combined with the destruction of Dresden (a city described as a ""picture of Heaven"" (189)) produces a depressed, negative tone that hovers over the entire plot. In this way Vonnegut condemns warfare in all respects without explicitly saying anything for one side or another.Kurt Vonnegut set out to write an ""anti-war book"" (4). He undoubtedly accomplished this. What makes this particular novel unique is not the fact that he told a story that is clearly against warfare, but that he did so without preaching, without politicking, with no suspense, and without a climax! Vonnegut's masterful use of tone and fractured plot lines accomplishes the task in a truly original way. In the process, he introduced some interesting ideas, as well.Vonnegut's perspective on death is one-of-a-kind. He also introduces exceptional thoughts on time and the futility of war prevention. The Tralfamadorians see time ""the way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains... They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them"" (34). In contrast, humans see time as one moment following another moment, ""like beads on a string"" (34). The Tralfamadorians tell Billy that human perceptions are restricted and we cannot see time for what it really is. This idea of non-sequential, uncontrolled perception of time is very interesting. His second notion was that trying to stop wars from happening was like trying to stop glaciers from moving. One character says ""that there would always be wars, that they were as easy to stop as glaciers"" (4). This idea is backed up by the Tralfamadorians, too. Billy expects them to be shocked with the violence on Earth, but is surprised to learn that the aliens ""have wars as horrible as any you've seen or read about"" (150). Also, although the Tralfamadorians can see into the future, they say that ""There isn't anything we can do about [the wars], so we simply don't look at them. We ignore them"" (150). It appears that although Vonnegut is against wars, he realizes that there will always be something to fight about. It is as easy to stop wars as it is to stop a glacier's movement. Vonnegut brought up some very intriguing points, but refrained from speaking of others that would seem obvious.Oddly enough, though this novel focuses on World War Two, yet the issues of the Holocaust and Nazism are completely left out. Almost any other book dealing with period of history will mention both of those topics, but this story mentions neither. It does not mention the Pacific theater of war or nuclear weapons. This decision was made by the author to allow more emphasis to be placed on this story. The reader can take in this story by itself and not be distracted by other topics.Certain points discussed in this story seem very believable, while others are outright ridiculous. For instance, the idea that dead people are still alive in the past makes sense. However, Rosewater's statement that ""Absolutely everyone gets a little something [from war]"" (141) has no logic behind it. Vonnegut supports the anti-war side of the book in a clever way; everyone that supports the war is perceived as crazy, while those who dislike war are seen as logical people. For instance, a colonel infected with double pneumonia and near death tries to give a speech ""to his beloved troops for the last time"" (85) to inspire them to stay strong, as he sways and loses control of his body. He soon dies. On the other hand, Mary O'Hare verbally assaults the author about making ""war look wonderful, so we'll have more of them [and they'll kill] babies"" (18). Later, they had a discussion and ""she was my friend after that"" (19). The believable points are anti-war comments or unrelated to war, while the implausible remarks are made war-supporting characters.Vonnegut's control over literary tools reveals a deeper understanding of the text. He keeps the diction and syntax simple and direct, which allows the reader to easily understand the text. If the prose is easily understood, the reader can spend more time thinking about the story itself, especially the structure of the plot. Early in the novel, the narrator tells the reader that the book ""is so short and jumbled and jangled... because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre"" (24). This statement reveals that the author feels the bombing of Dresden was a massacre and that the plot will be short and jumbled. The tone for the rest of the story has also been set by that sentence. The reader knows that the story will be about a great loss of life. A dark tone hanging over a plot full of death and war will produce an anti-war sentiment. No persuasion from the characters or author will be necessary to convince readers that war is terrible.Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-5 is a science fiction, anti-war novel that fits neatly into neither category. The story is not focused on science fiction, nor is the plot blatantly against war. However, through expert manipulation of literary tools, plot structure, and implementation of original ideas, Vonnegut creates a masterpiece that becomes anti-war with a unique twist of science fiction. This was a thoroughly good read that everyone should experience at least once. In the spirit of Billy Pilgrim, ""Farewell, hello, farewell, hello!"" (181).",en
B0006AST0M,4.0,"Lie Down in Darkness is not a great book. But it is a very good one, and shows how William Styron, even in his youth was a talented and perceptive writer. This novel begins with the death of Peyton Loftis, and goes back in time to follow her childhood and coming of age, as well as her eventual marriage, until her death. We see these pictures through the alternating points of view mostly of her father and mother, but also of some other characters, and learn how her death was inextricably related to the slow attrition caused by stubborness, jealousy, and hate that tears apart her family. Darkness is everywhere in the novel, taking the form of guilt and personal failures that corrode the hearts of each character and make inevitable Peyton's tragic end. Indeed the predetermination is all the more evident, since we know from the very beginning that she has died.Although Sophie's Choice shows how much more polished (and more thoughtful too, perhaps) he has become as a writer, Styron's writing is beautiful, as are the characters and the story. This may not be a necessary read, and the beginning may be slow, but it was well worth my time.",en
B000MZW2AO,5.0,"If you aren't familiar with this story, then you must not have been paying attention all these years since it was published (in 1952), but just in case: Charlotte's Web is the story of a girl named Fern who convinces her father, ax in hand, to allow her to take care of the runt of the most recent litter of pigs instead of (ahem) doing what he'd planned. But all good things must come to an end, and once he reaches the right size, they sell him to a neighbor, who, Fern learns, plans to take him to the fair to sell for slaughter. Fortunately, Wilbur befriends a wise spider named Charlotte, who devises a plan that, with the reluctant help of a rat, she hopes will save his life. Templeton, a gluttonous rat with an attitude, is bribed into tracking down appropriately intriguing words that Charlotte then weaves into a web in his pen. As hoped, once they arrive at the fair, folks show up in droves to admire Zuckerman's Famous Pig. Over the years, I've read the book, watched the movie and listened to author E.B. White read his story. The movie does justice to the story, but it's best experienced in its original form, as read by the author. Charlotte's Web is a fantastic, family-friendly (age 8 and up, for some sad stuff near the end) story about friendship. Also good: Essays by E.B. White, Emmy and the Incredible Shrinking Rat by Lynne Jonell and The Cricket of Times Square by George Selden.",en
0582538319,5.0,"I initially lamented the fact that Hard Times was assigned to me in my British lit. class. I had read some of Dickens's melodramas like A Tale of Two Cities and Oliver Twist and enjoyed them, but everything I heard about Hard Times said this was nothing like those. This was supposedly just strictly social commentary. My interpretation of that: BORING.But then I read it.Hard Times isn't like Dickens's other novels, but I don't think that it has any less heart than those masterpieces. In fact, Dickens endured himself much further to me with this novel as he has his characters perform Thomas Carlyle's enduring philosophy.The novel follows the Gradgrind family who is raised adhering to FACTS and living in a society which worships the manufacturing machine. As the novel progresses, connections are made and broken, and the characters come to the realization that there is much more to reality than the material facts.Hard Times is told so compassionately. The reader cares for these people and their tragic lives. The story is also told with biting humor that still cuts at today's society (this novel feels really modern), and the underlying philosophy is one which is so needed in our post-modern world. I would certainly recommend this novel to fans of Dickens and to fans of the truly literary novel.",en

B000NQ9QF6,5.0,"Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.,is a self-described ""trafficker in climaxes and thrills and characterization and wonderful dialogue and suspense and confrontations."" To this end, ""Slaughterhouse-Five or the Children's Crusade: A Duty Dance With Death,"" is a brilliant and outrageous antiwar book about the catastrophic World War II fire bombing of Dresden, Germany.Vonnegut delivers serious messages coated in humor. For instance, early in the narrative he states that there is ""nothing intelligent to say about a massacre."" And then adds, ""I have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part in massacres, and that the news of massacres of enemies is not to fill them with satisfaction or glee."" The author then drives his convictions home by clearly explaining, ""I have also told them not to work for companies which make massacre machinery, and to express contempt for people who think we need machinery like that.""This is a remarkable book. Vonnegut expresses his antiwar outrage with blistering humor. And by the way...Billy Pilgrim and the Tralfamadorians will leave you in stitches. So it goes.Bert Ruiz",en

It is a well-written novel with an original, unique and solid plot, extremely well-done setting, good action, dialogue, etc. All these aspect alone would give the book 5 stars.What makes me say it needs an extra star are the characters. No other novel I know of describes its characters better, or makes them more realistic and belivable. You will never forget Heathcliff. He's a person so set in his cruel ways as to be almost unbelievable - it's hard to imagine someone like that could exist. And yet Emily Bronte pulls it off with her writing. She makes you BELIEVE.

0781229146,5.0,"Progress & Poverty is the missing puzzle piece for those of us who look around at the combination of magnificent and accelerating technological progress and the increasingly distorted distribution of income and wealth in America, with many people lacking sufficient income to meet their most basic needs, and wonder what went wrong in a country which professes to be dedicated to the proposition that we're all created equal.The book's subtitle -- An Inquiry in the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase of Wealth... The Remedy -- describes it beautifully: why we have the ups and downs of our economy, which cause incredible human misery, and why we have increasing poverty at the same time that there is hugely increasing wealth.And Henry George provides a logical and workable -- even elegant -- remedy, one which will untangle many of the perverse incentives we cope with today: we say we value work, but we tax it. We say we want to promote sales, but we tax them. We say we want to encourage entrepreneurial effort, but we allow huge barriers designed to discourage the person with an idea from being able to execute it. We say we want a society that naturally creates more jobs, but we allow a relative few of us to pocket the funds which would create those jobs. We say we value initiative, but we reward the ""dog in the manger"" far more than we reward the laborer. We say that urban blight is a bad thing, but our tax code encourages it. We say we dislike urban sprawl, and long commutes, and low wages -- but we've failed to implement the simple tax reform that will correct these ills. We work longer hours than our counterparts in other countries, and have less to show for it. We allow a relative few to own our airwaves, and resell them at higher and higher prices, collecting advertising revenues from all who would run for public office or advertise their products.If we truly mean to end poverty, to reward initiative, to ensure that the next child born in America is truly the equal of all who are here today, to ensure that our environment is protected for the common good, George's framework for understanding provides the missing puzzle piece.And as we consider what sort of country we'd like Iraq to be, it is worth considering that if we only give them a constitution without giving them an economic system that considers all people equal, truly equal, we've not accomplished much with the American lives we've lost there.If we can figure it out for Iraq, with all its oil wealth, maybe we can figure out how to share America justly among Americans, too.George lays out simply and elegantly what the underlying problem is and how to solve it.He dedicates the book ""To those who, seeing the vice and misery that spring from the unequal distribution of wealth and privilege, feel the possibility of a higher social state and would strive for its attainment."" Might you be among those who see and feel, and would strive, if only you could see the source of the problem?Churchill, Twain, Huxley, Shaw and many others came to see what George was pointing out. Will you?This one is worth your time!Get a copy for yourself, and send one to your favorite legislator, be he/she local, state or federal.

I liked the book for its description of English soldiers' lives in India a century ago and for the well-crafted varied characters that populate the novel.The story is set in colonial India and is not your predictable love story, but quite full of surprises and turns in the plot. I enjoyed reading every second of it and was delighted to add some not commonly used words to my vocabulary. I enjoyed reading a story set and written in a different era.",en

B000NZ6C3G,2.0,"I had to read this over the summer for my English class. Frankly, I think that a much better translation could have been chosen. Greek is not based on word order, as is English, and thus two words, say ""big man"" are often separated in a sentence. Lattimore, rather than taking the logical route and putting the words together, often translates them in the order that they appear in the text! So then that sentence becomes: ""the man, walking across the field, big, kills another man."" As you can see, this often leads to confusion, as it is hard to tell which words modify one another. It also sounds very awkward and unpoetic. Indeed, I feel that Lattimore steals the poetic beauty away from Homer's masterpiece. I wish I could read Greek to experience it in its original form!Despite its monotony and confusion, however, I suppose this translation would be excellent for someone studying the text rather than reading it for the sake of reading, since it is basically word by word.",en

Each daughter and their mother is complete, distinct unto themselves. They are fully human, making mistakes and even being unlikable at frequent intervals, yet since you are seing their failures through their own eyes, you cannot help but love them for it and become intimately invested in them and their story.Let me also add that anyone who loves puzzles will be delighted by Adah's chapters.

The man known only as Heathcliff. *Don Don Don!*The novel starts out in an unusual manner of telling the end of the story in the beginning. Surprisingly all the substance plays right in tune with the style of writing. The characters of all very complex and intricate to the point of instanity. The story is all centered around a man who is rejected from society from adoption and is only loved by a one soul. Unbeknownst to his step sister Catherine, Heathcliff has fallen madly in love with her. Heathcliff ,since rejected from society, has developed deep hatred for everyone who maltreated him or loved Catherine.Heathcliff's revenge is so cold and rotten to the point were you want to rip the book apart and burn it. Later on Catherine finally confesses her love to Heathcliff whom after this was overjoyed with passion. Sadly this Catherine,Heathcliff's only true love in life, dies a most unusual death.Heathcliff plans to make Catherines daughter the puppet or weapon if you may to take revenge against Edgar the one who stole Catherine from Heathcliff's reach. To do this he tries to force Catherine's daughter to marry his own son.Although the book is very entertaining I highly suggest this for and audience of some background knowledge of the Victorian era. Another tedious thing of this book is it is not intended to those of an average vocabulary so at often found myself having to grab a dictionary. Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights novel shows how love can eventually turn into hate by just adding a few essential ingredients.[Redsponx5]",en

I could not quite understand what the fuss was all about. However, ""The Law is For All"" explained-away all those little things that had confused me or led me to believe that ""The Book of The Law"" was just Crowley's personal writings. When I started looking into all this, I was a firm believer that Crowley was the man I had read about from Colin Wilson's perspective and Nevill Drury's perspective, etc. In other words, my opinions were formed by the Research of others.... Yet, when I actually took the time to sit-down and read Crowley's works--well, I was amazed at his Genius and his Anthropological views of Humanity. I never expected to gain Anthropology lessons from his works--but, he was truly an Observer of the Human Condition....all of which adds to this ""Commentary"" on the ""Book of The Law.""What amazed me, until I realized that this book was written in the same way as all other ""Holy Books,"" was the fact that it is, in fact, a ""Holy Book."" This book was written in the same fashion as ""The Book of Mormon"" or any other ""Holy Book.""Aliester Crowley served as The Prophet, and the book was written Through him (even if he was not exactly happy to be the Writer of the Work).""The Law is For All"" has awakened me to the validity of certain religions that I had never really considered as such, previously.

0786244402,2.0,"The premise for this WWII novel is excellent, however the execution is awful. This is just about the worst written historical novel I've ever read, and I've read a bunch. The story is based on a Marine Corps myth, which the author notes there is absolutely no record of, or any of the participants, in any USMC records. A number of readers seem to have totally missed this distinction, and think it really happened! Oh well... the story starts by establishing wartime Shanghai, the far eastern city of spies, where American soldiers mix with British administrators, exiled White Russians, and diplomats of all shades and stripes. When a warning of imminent war with Japan is sent out to all American forces in the weeks prior to Pearl Harbor, it becomes clear that the American units will need to retreat from China, which is largely under Japanese occupation. Although most of these troops are concentrated in various bases, there are a few isolated outposts. This is where Cpt. Billy Port, USMC comes in.The younger son of a prominent and somewhat notorious Boston family, Port is highly regarded in the Marine Corps for his works with Gen. ""Chesty"" Puller in Central America. The first part of the book establishes the lush life of Shanghai and his comfortable living, including an ""arrangement"" with a beautiful young White Russian exile woman, and weekly tennis matches with an American-born, UCLA educated, Japanese officer. No points for guessing that the latter part of the book will pit friend against friend... When the warning of war comes, Port is tasked with traveling across China to gather up the far-flung American units, and lead them to safety. To do so, he handpicks a small unit and sets up a convoy of four trucks and his Bentley convertible for the mission.The unit he assembles is part central casting, part improbable fancy. There's a Mexican sergeant who's gimmick is that he served with Pershing against Pancho Villa and talks about it incessently. Somehow this manages to be as equally irritating to the reader (because it's not funny), as it's meant to be to the other characters. There's ""Sparky"" the radio guy, the grease-monkey/mechanic, a big brave lummox carrying the heavy gun, a bunch of anonymous BAR grunts, a college-boy Naval reserve lieutenant, and (I'm not making this up!), his Chinese butler, a world-famous French race-car driver, and a White Russian alternately referred to as ""General"", ""Count"", and ""Prince"" Yusopov. Along the way, they pick up a female Chinese doctor, and a British Catholic priest/paleontologist. Now, an able writer (such as George MacDonald Fraser) could have had a lot of fun with this wild and wacky cast, but Brady just isn't up to it. These characters either seem to serve no discernable purpose (such as the Naval officer), or are very convenient devices (the Russian teaches the Marines how to make a Molotov cocktail and just happens to have a brother at a monastery where sanctuary is available at a critical time, the English priest just happens to know the whole country like the back of his hand and speaks the dialects, etc.).The bulk of the book is one extended chase scene, as this motley band of brothers makes its way across the Chinese country, skirmishing with bandits, ducking Japanese Zeros, suffering in the elements, and ultimately, racing for the Soviet border. The action sequences are far and away the strongest parts, from ambushing a pursing patrol, to facing down huge bandit hordes, it's good stuff (if somewhat predictable). Alas, the bulk of the book is riddled with cliche, repetition (for example, the term ""top sergeant"" is explained several times), and awkwardness (for example, every time Port meets with his ""staff"", Brady feels compelled to run through the roll call of who is present). It's the kind of story that might work better as a film, where one is a little more forgiving of hokiness and the dialogue would be much tighter. In any event, Port's race across China is a promising idea for a story, but this book just doesn't deliver the goods.",en

This is NOT a pro-Bush writing - it is an exposition of truth, and a warning - the title of Commander in Chief should not be taken lightly!! My suggestion, though it may be difficult, is to please only read this if you can put aside media comments and rhetoric ahead of time. Also, please talk to a Veteran or talk to a POW, before or after you read this book, most importantly, prior to the election. I have a deep respect for veterans, my father was in WWII and I was very uninformed about Vietnam (also recommend Stolen Valor). In fact, I had a very bad taste in my mouth regarding Vietnam Veterans (I grew up believing and ignorantly not researching the basis for the slander of such Vets). You will not understand where the Swift Boat Veterans are coming from if you:1) do not at least basically understand history - how it repeats itself, and how that is important when choosing a President.2) do not basically understand the ""job specs"" for being Commander in Chief (which don't include being a Veteran - although a plus, and do not include being a wounded Vet)3) do not have some kind of unbiased, basic knowledge of the Vietnam war (including, how the U.S. got involved, by what President and why we continued, and how we ""exited"").4) do not understand what occurred with and the impact that the 'nam protestors had on society's view of Vietnam, the U.S. and the Veterans - plus the fallible recordings of events that were included in text books and history classes in schools - believe me, I know what I was taught regarding Vietnam when I was growing up and I realize how incorrect and slanted most of it was!)It is quite clear that the authors and their ""brothers"", and no doubt many Veterans all across America, were deeply wounded, emotionally and sometimes physically, due to the protesting, anarchist scum that monopolized the nightly news in the late '60's and early 70's, and even on into today. Kerry has clearly of his own choosing and accord, opened wounds that were clearly not healed, opened himself up to scrutiny, and ""brought this on.""

I didn't say whether or not that was a good or a bad thing, but it will change the way you think.Many people will find this book to be to dry. The book doesn't have much action as I said before. However, if you go into the book with an open mind you may get a lot out of it. The focal point of this book is your thinking about what is said, and really that would be the only problem. If you don't feel like thinking there are a million other books out there. But if you want to re-access the world around you, sort of put things into perspective, this is your book.I think this book is well worth a look. I was given a list of books to read by my professor and I chose this one (some of my friends had read it). Basically, I know I made the right decision. At first I was a bit weary. I had only a couple days to go and I had barely gotten to the 100th page. I started to turn on the book. Then, in the middle of all my cramming, my view of ""when is this damn thing going to end"" suddenly changed to ""wow...this guy is right.."" and when the book ended suddenly seemed to be an imminent downer.When it did finally end I was very happy with my decision to read it and I highly recommend it. I have already suggested it to a few of my friends and I plan to re-read it again shortly.",en

B0006AVGBQ,5.0,"If you enjoy personal narratives of combat experiences, you cannot miss with this book. It is a tale told in simple, direct, yet poignant language. There is no ""big picture."" It is what is all around you up to a distance of about 100 yards. It is what is stepped on & what collapses upon you. It is what whizzes by your ears & plays out indelibly before your unblinking eyes.In a much smaller measure than the experiences of the author, this book will leave you forever changed.",en
0609808265,2.0,"I just finished reading this book andBlood River: A Journey to Africa's Broken Heart, which deal with very similar journeys. And while I initially liked this book, the other was better overall.The author writes this as a kind of ""finding himself"" journey. He feels his life in Russia, with a wonderful girlfriend and steady job, is insufficiently challenging, and that he need to find out who he is. He settles on a pirogue (dugout canoe) journey down the Congo river as the best way to do this. In contrast to Tim Butcher's overland journey from Lake Tanganyika, Jeffrey Tayler starts out by going upriver by ferryboat, and then trying to go down river with just himself and a guide to paddle his boat. And while the journey upriver is interesting, the books starts to lag once he begins the downriver stretch. Tayler makes contact with many different characters on his trip, but too often, it seems his is more absorbed in his own thoughts than he is interested in the country of the people. He spends a great deal of time (understandably) battling homesickness and talking about his life in Russia. The language is much less colorful than that of Tim Butcher's book, and there are minimal historical asides. For example he mentions ""water hyacinth"" several dozen times, but I didn't learn until reading Butcher's book that the plan is actually not native to the Congo, and that eradication of the invader has been a major undertaking to preserve the navigability of the river.In short, while I enjoyed reading this book, and was intrigued enough to read more about the Congo, I felt I learned far more about the people, the history, the country, and even the author by reading Tim Butcher's book. Worth checking this one out, but there are other works that are more rewarding.",en

Yes, the stuff now seems hackneyed, so what? Doc invented it, and we should respect that .

3890646603,5.0,"Shadowrun has been around for ages. And that's a good thing. Far too many games have gone into the D20 slump. Far too many good games, over the years, have been lost to the sands of time. Yet to see that some names, like RuneQuest and Earthdawn, are still around brings a cheer to this old gamer's heart. And it is even better to see that games like Shadowrun, instead of falling into a spiral, can actually grow better and better. Shadowrun is kicking and alive in all its intricate glory. Still has the wonderful fantasy appearance, still has the grand cyberpunk grime. A lot of games have problems if they try to throw too many concepts and genres together. Shadowrun has never had that problem. The character creation is easy to learn, easy to work with. The dice system is reasonable and also easy to grasp. I think though that what really draws people to this game, as people have been drawn to it since it first opened its eyes with FASA, was the setting. The setting works. It is just that simple. You can dive into the setting and find new things to develop, new points to discover, and new avenues to explore. The campaign world is one of the best. If you are tired, and I really am myself tired of D20, then you really need to take a second look at this game. Buy it. It is worth it. You as the GM will love it, your players will love it.",en
B000J1OR0Y,5.0,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy changed my life. Its as simple as that. Everyone should read this book, and you will be changed by the reading of it. It is the most amazing work of fiction ever attempted by mortal man. So, what makes me rave so much about this book? To start with it is incredibly well written, (and even that is an understatement) it is so moving - I have never experienced such a wide range of emotions simply by just reading a book! Yes, you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll come away will a whole new outlook on life. Basically the main character,Frodo, who is one of those stupid, absurb and lovable creatures called hobbits, discovers that he posseses the most powerful object in the whole of Middle Earth, a seemingly innocent gold ring. Everyone from the Dark Lord down is searching for the ring while Middle Earth is ravaged by war and evil. Frodo undertakes his quest to destroy the ring and what follows is a story of battles,the struggle for freedom, fading ages - but mostly of how one person can make a difference and change the world. Someone once told me that 'you've never lived unless you've read the Lord of the Rings' and they were right. This trilogy is stunning in every sense of the word.",en

B000IEZE3G,5.0,"I bought this book for my grandson, but found myself a bit curious about Harry Potter. So, I thought I'd read a few pages, just to get an idea as to what all of the excitement was about. I have now ordered the second book in the series (for myself) because I want to see how much trouble this young wizard can get into and out of!I found that Harry was a little like Cinderella - with a much more exciting life. I loved the way he learned that he was a famous wizard, and I especially enjoyed reading about the way he found and rode the train to Hogewarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.J. K. Rowling certainly is able to create realisic and fascinating characters who live in an exciting new world of trolls, potions, owls who deliver the mail, brooms that fly, and a wild wizards' game called Quidditch. I enjoyed meeting Harry's new friends, the Hogwart professors, and, yes, even the evil characters. But, most of all, I became entranced with the plot, in which Harry, who never knew he was a famous wizard, learns how to become one. He does this by meeting one challenge after another, and, with the help of his new friends, overcomes each.I couldn't put the book down, and now I can't wait to read Book 2. As an old 2nd and 5th grade teacher, who also taught college students, I highly recommend this book to everyone, young and old alike. A little bit of fantasy, mixed in with a little bit of adventure, mixed in with a bunch of delightful characters, makes this Senior Citizen a happy reader.",en
0842332316,2.0,"This book,all 400 hundred pages,was by far the worst written of the series. The authors are dragging out the series with long detailed, boring ""fillers"". They know they have us hooked and are trying to gain profit, instead of the true meaning of what the series is supposed to be about. I enjoyed the other 7, but this one was awful. Of course we have to wait another 8 months for the 9th book, and of course I will read it, I am hooked. Also don't buy the video ""Left Behind"".

1893765008,2.0,"With all due respect to Mr. Smith as a lifelong devotee of the martial arts, this books sounds like it is written by a dilettante. His quotes of literary figures seem forced or out of context at many places in the narrative. The book's literary allusions read as if Mr. Smith is trying to demonstrate how erudite he is. He does the same thing with his martial arts experience. I found myself wondering if Mr. Smith spent any quality time mastering any one system outside of Judo. I expected the book to be something more than just a name dropping of who's who in the martial arts world. This is the problem with the charlatans he detracts who, upon having met someone of note or taken a few classes with them, think they can list it on their resumes. Mr. Smith rightfully gives respect where it is due, however, he does not provide much insight into the personalities of the twentieth-century's great masters, which I would have utlimately found more interesting than his opinions or complements of them.",en
B0009GVMVG,2.0,"I was surprisingly disappointed by this book, not, mind you, by the art and writing of Jack Cole, but by the book itself.I found this book to be one of those productions that is to clever by half. Neither fish nor fowl, Mr. Spiegelman's writing is to skimpy to be considered a complete biography and the art design by Mr. Kidd is so ""artistically"" (re)produced that it distracts from the person who should be the real star of this book, Jack Cole.This is the type of book that book reviewers who have no knowledge of sequential art call ""daring"" and ""cutting edge"".While Mr. Spiegelman's writing is basic and informative, it almost causes one pain to look at the bountiful list of comic book legends that he had access to and yet still failed to produce a more gripping and insightful look into Cole's life.And while Mr. Kidd's flair for artistic direction and experimentation is unassailable, a much lighter touch was called for as to not distract from the original artist and his work.If you are looking for a quick read with an interesting layout, you might enjoy this book.If you are looking for an in-depth biography of Jack Cole, I would suggest looking elsewhere. And, if you are looking for real Jack Cole storytelling, I would recommend that you check out Plastic Man Archives, Vol. 1 (also sold by Amazon).",en

Because I think of lighthearted humor when I think of Higgs, I was surprised in the best sort of way as I got into Thorn in My Heart. Higgs really did her homework before attempting such a project as this story. Right down to the quotes of the old masters of literature at the beginning of each chapter, the story is rich in every way. I loved the book and hated to see it end. It's one of the best books I've read in a long time. It's got depth, is colorful, entertaining and heart wrenching. It was fun to realize early in the book, the takeoff that it was on Jacob and Esau...right down to the same first initial of the characters as those in the story from Genesis. I can't wait until her 'Fair is the Rose' comes out and the opportunity to revisit Leana, Rose and Jamie.",en
1559270845,5.0,"This book was a great help to me when I breastfed my now almost 2 year old (fully weaned at 21 months). I encountered great difficulties with breastfeeding at first. However, through reading this book and support from other breastfeeding moms, I discovered that most of the problems I encountered were common and with a little work between me and my daughter, could be overcome so we could enjoy a wonderful, mutually beneficial breastfeeding experience. Unfortunately, there is not an overwhelming support system for breastfeeding moms in our society. Consequently, many moms, when encountering problems or disinterest in breastfeeding, switch to the bottle out of dire frustration, misinformation, and lack of support. This book does not push any propaganda, but gives accurate, trustworthy, and pertinent information about the many extreme benefits of breastfeeding. I want to encourage any mother trying to decide whether to breastfeed, encountering any type of breastfeeding problems, or in need of any type of breastfeeding support to read this book.",en

B000QBA9SQ,4.0,"Former go-go dancer and personal trainer turned amateur private-eye Scotty Bradley is back in ""Mardi Gras Mambo."" Again based in New Orleans (as is its author Greg Heren), this third book in the series was delayed due to the author's forced temporary relocation from that city, although the author wisely avoids including the hurricane in the book, since this is very much about the ""party hearty"" New Orleans that may take some time to come back, but hopefully will.This time around, Scotty is in the private eye business with his two lovers, former federal agent Frank and the mysterious Colin, both of whom entered his life in the last book. The fourth main character of the book seems to be the drug Ecstasy, which all three of them find to as necessary as a gym-toned body and a hot costume before going out to party in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. When Scotty's Russian-born Ecstasy dealer turns up dead, shortly after he leaves the dealer's apartment, Scotty becomes a suspect and starts an investigation of his own, with Frank's and Colin's help. What they find is a strange story involving a gay porn site, the Russian mob, a suspicious charater watching their apartment, and a three-for-all filling in another story about Scotty's strange family history.Like the previous ones in the series, this book is not for everyone, but is a highly enjoyable purely escapist novel with a passable (though barely plausible, compared to past books in the series) mystery content to hold one's interest. I like Herren's style, and although I'm sure his depiction of the rampant drug use in New Orleans, especially during Mardi Gras, isn't far from accurate, I wish he would have not made Ecstasy seem as socially acceptable and tolerated as an occasional joint, since it is a message I would not have wanted to send to younger gay readers sure to pick up his novel. I give the book an overall four stars out of five, but was contemplating taking away one star because of the endorsement of that drug.",en
